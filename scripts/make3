# Make all 3 images, their TFTF files, and  FFFF file, and the bootrom image.
#
# Usage:
#    make3 {-es2tsb | -es3tsb | -fpgatsb } {-sign} {-v} {-dbg} \
#          {-nocrypto} {-gearchange} {-nodelay} {-debugmsg} {-handshake} \
#          {--spec=<num>} {-dme} {-342} --rev=<revision>
#
#    -es2tsb, -es3tsb, -fpgatsb
#              Select the build target
#    -sign     Sign both level 2 & 3 firmware
#    -dbg      Compile with debugging symbols
#    -v        Verbose mode on TFTF creation
#    -prod     Enable _PRODUCTION mode for all 3 firmware levels
#
# TESTING parameters:
#    -nocrypto		Substitute fake cryptographic routines to speed simulation
#    -gearchange	Test for changing UniPro gear change
#    -nodelay		Disable a 100 ms delay after loading from SPI
#    -debugmsg		Allow debug serial output
#    -handshake		GPIO handshake with simulation/test controller
#    --spec=<num>	Compile special test number <num>.
#    -dme               Enable DME-write logging
#    -342		Substitute the L3FW for L2FW to speed simulation
#    --rev=<revision>    The revision in git to build the boot ROM code
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Make the s3FW, s2FW and the FFFF
makef4 $*

# Make the s1FW (aka BootRom)
